# Database Migrations

- **Only the developer** is allowed to run migrations, or when permission is explicitly conceded.
- Migrations must be run **only** via the `./migrate` command (never `python manage.py migrate` or `makemigrations` directly unless instructed).
- When migration-related changes are needed, suggest the edits and remind the user to run `./migrate` themselves.
